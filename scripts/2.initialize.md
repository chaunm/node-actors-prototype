Initialization
======

**Step 1 (User side)**
- Bob read the instruction, using wifi for initialization
- Bob connect to the his Home wifi

**Step 2 (User side)**
- App detects changes in the network, broadcasting UDP packets to find out if
there any gateway near by
- If the app can't find any, it will connect to the Cloud
- App display information about his account
- Stop here!!!

**Step 3 (User side)**
If the app finds the gateway, it first connects to the gateway system (port 1883)
with with the default account (anonymous/anonymous).

This account is created by default for any uninitialized gateways.

**Step 4 (User side)**
- The app subscribes to initializer/event/bonjour
- Render any information return
- Bob then provides information to access his home's Wifi AP
- App publish the configuration to `initializer/request/connect_wifi`

**Step 5 (Both sides)**
This step happens in parallel
*Thread 1 (Gateway side)*
- actorInitializer asks actorWifi to connect to the new Wifi
- actorWifi emits its status via `event/status`
- actorInitializer gets for actorWifi status
- if it's failed, actorInitializer tell actorWifi to start_open --> stop here!!!
- actorInitializer tell actorLed to turn_on(green)

*Thread 2 (User side)*
- App may support the job of re-connecting to Bob's most recent wifi
- Or else, app must let Bob know
- App detects changes in the network, searching for the gateway
- If it's not found:
  - App let Bob know to connect back
  - Back to **step 2**
- App connects to the gateway system with the previous account
- App notify Bob that: the configuration is successful
- App publishes Bob's id to `initializer/request/finalize`
- App displays syncing pages

**Step 6 (Gateway side)**
- start actor Bridge:
  bridge{
    request{
      connect(gateway_uuid, gateway_token, bob_uuid),
      disconnect
    },
    event{
        bonjour,
        status
    }
  }
