## User
- A user named Bob
- He bought Viva Security

- He doesn't have any account on our System
- He may registers an account with:
  + A phone number & password, full name (we only support this in v1)
  + A unique user name & password (not support)
  + Via his Facebook or Google account (not support)

- He may login into the app via his preferred account

- The app stores his identity (
    full name,
    generated id = user name hash,
    password hash
  )

- He turns on Viva Gateway

## Gateway
1. Bob may optionally hard-reset the gateway
2. The gateway is first in the uninitialized state.
3. After being turned on, the actor system is started:

- start actor initializer:
  + act (pub any): system/initializer/act/{
        connect_wifi,
        finalize
      }
  + event (sub any): system/initializer/event/{
        bonjour,
        status
      }

- start actor wifi
    + act: system/wifi/v1.0/act/{
        broadcast(ssid, password),
        disconnect,
        connect(ssid, password) // no parameter to connect to the previous one
      }
    + event: system/wifi/v1.0/event/status (retained message)

- start actor LED
    + act: system/led/v1.0/act/{turn_on(color), turn_off, flash(color), error}

4. The Actor System knows that it's uninitialized, so
- wifi.act.start_open
- led.act.flash(yellow): notify users to configure
- if there's something wrong, led.act.error
