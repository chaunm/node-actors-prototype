## 1. Actors
### 1.1 Overview
Actors are programming concepts to model entities communicating via messages.
+ Can be implemented in any programming language
+ Have their own mailboxes which are authorized topics on a message broker.
+ Can be featured by a uid (locally or globally)

### 1.2 Mailboxes
A mailbox (a topic) can be configured to subscribe or publish to a specific set of actors.
+ Each mailbox has its own URIs
+ URIs can be organized into APIs. For example `<uid>/request/add_device`

An actor can operate only on 3 kind of mailboxes which are:

**Request mailboxes:**
+ URIs: `<uid>/request/#`
+ to store messages asking the actor do something
+ Only authorized actors can publish messages to this mailboxes
+ Only the owning actor can subscribe to

**Response mailboxes**
+ URIs: `<uid>/response` (no sub-topic)
+ Store response messages from other actors upon request messages.
+ Each response messages must have `request` fields to refer back to associated `Request messages`

**Event mailboxes:**
+ URIs: `<uid>/event/#`
+ to store events emitted by the actor
+ Only the owning actor can publish to
+ Only authorized actors can subscribe to

### 1.3 Messages
Interchanged messages are in JSON format.
Broker will intercept such messages, appending `from` fields:

**Example 1: Request & Response messages**

A requests B to add_device and B responses. Let's assume that A is authorized

*Step 1: A publishes a request message to B-uid/request/add_device*

```javascript
{
	from, // A's uid, added by the broker automatically
	id, // generated by A to trigger the associated callback
	param
}
```

*Step 2: B executes the request, replying to A-uid/response*

```javascript
{
	from, // B's uid, added by Message Broker automatically
	request, // original request message
	response // key-value pairs
}
```

**Example 2: Events**

Actor Wifi can emit `connected` events to `event/connected`:

```javascript
{
	from, // B's uid, added by Message Broker automatically
	param // any 	
}
```

## 2. Actor Commons

This section defines a common interface about what Actors must conform in our Actor System

### 2.1  General
- Must securely maintain their uid & tokens which are used to connect to our brokers

- Must conform `Actor life cycle`

```text
`stopped` -> `starting` -> `started` -> `stopping` --> `stopped` ...
									 -> 'stopped' (if error)
						-> `stopped` (if error)

```

### 2.2 Response
Any response must contain the original request. For example:

```javascript
{
	from, // B's uid, added by Message Broker automatically
	request, // original request message
	response // key-value pairs
}
```

### 2.3 Requests
Must response to special requests

#### 2.3.1 Intro
**Purpose** Get meta data about the actor

**mailbox** `request/intro`

**message:**
```javascript
{
	from, // sender's guid, added by Message Broker automatically  
  id, // generated & maintained by the actor (for callbacks)
}
```

**response**
Upon finishing these requests, it should send a response to the sender's `/response` mailbox with following info:

```javascript
{
	from, // wifi guid, added by Message Broker automatically
  request, // the original request here
	response: {
		status: "status.actor.{success,failed}",
		uid: "string",
		name: "string",
		description: "string",
		version: "string",
		developer: "string",
		release: "release date"
	}
}
```

#### 2.3.2 Stop
**Purpose** Safely stop any activities

**mailbox** `request/stop`

**message:**
```javascript
{
	from, // sender's guid, added by Message Broker automatically  
  id, // generated & maintained by the actor (for callbacks)
}
```

**response**
Upon finishing these requests, it should send a response to the sender's `/response` mailbox:

```javascript
{
	from, // wifi guid, added by Message Broker automatically
  request, // the original request here
  response: {
    status: "status.actor.{success,failed}",
  }
}
```

### 2.4 Events
- Periodically emit `status event` via `event/status` (every 5s).
For example:

```javascript
{
	from, // uid of the emitter, added by Message Broker automatically
	event: "event.actor.{stopped, starting, started, stopping}",
	error: "describing error (optionally if there is any)"
}
```



## 3. Actor System
Actor system contains 3 layers and boot in order

1. Core services: Primitive services
- Validator: validate all components
- LED controllers
- Message broker: eMQTT
- Database (redis)
- ActorUp: activates all actors

2. Actors: executable programs in any programming language

**System Service Actor**
- Initializer: initialize devices in the first time
- Updater: check for any update
- Monitor: monitor actor/messages statuses
- Broker: configure brokers (acl, authen)
- Database: database service
- Bridge: connect to the cloud (if feasible)
- Analytics
- Logger
- Housekeeper

**Driver service actor**
- znp
- wifi
- led
- speaker


**Device actors**: A hardware abstraction layer
- Abstract device actors
- Triggers

**User actors**
- Any registered & authorized users
